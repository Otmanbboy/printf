# _printf :page_facing_up:

A formatted output conversion C program completed as part of the low-level
programming and algorithm track at Alx-SE program. The program is a pseudo-
recreation of the C standard library function, `printf`.

## Dependencies :couple:

The `_printf` function was coded on an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS machine with `gcc`.

## Usage :running:

To use the `_printf` function, assuming the above dependencies have been installed,
compile all `.c` files in the repository and include the header `main.h` with
any main function.

Example `main.c`:
```
#include "main.h"

int main(void)
{
    _printf("Hello, World!");

    return (0);
}
```

Compilation:
```
$ gcc *.c -o tester
```

Output:
```
$ ./tester
Hello, World!
$
```

## Description :speech_balloon:

The function `_printf` writes output to standard output. The function writes
under the control of a `format` string that specifies how subsequent arguments
(accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of `stdarg`) are
converted for output.

Prototype: `int _printf(const char *format, ...);`

### Return Value

Upon successful return, `_printf` returns the number of characters printed
(excluding the terminating null byte used to end output to strings). If an
output error is encountered, the function returns `-1`.

### Format of the Argument String

The `format` string argument is a constant character string composed of zero
or more directives: ordinary characters (not `%`) which are copied unchanged
to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in
fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Conversion specification is
introduced by the character `%` and ends with a conversion specifier. In
between the `%` character and conversion specifier, there may be (in order)
zero or more _flags_, an optional minimum _field width_, an optional
_precision_ and an optional _length_ modifier. The arguments must correspond
with the conversion specifier, and are used in the order given.
